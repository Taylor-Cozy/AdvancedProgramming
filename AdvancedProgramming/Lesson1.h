	/* Exercise 1
		Find out what is the difference between a “signed” and an “unsigned” integer. When might you
		use an unsigned integer instead of a signed integer?

		Unsigned integers can hold positive numbers only (including 0). Signed integers can hold negative integers too, this shifts
		the range to include negative numbers meaning the number of positive numbers that can be held is effectively halved.
